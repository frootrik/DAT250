For this hand-in, I struggled with setting up the stub-data. I regrettably did not start early enough on this assignment, as there were more pressing assignments in other subjects. 

My specific technical issue was between the ownerUserId that I made in the stub data in my svelte files, and the backend. This was just a silly mistake that took too long to figure out of, and to make the request work. It took so long however, that I haven't resolved the fetching of the poll, which I wanted to display underneath the poll form.
