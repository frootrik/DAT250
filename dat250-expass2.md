### Technical Problems 

I did not encounter many technical problems. I started my masters the previous semester, in which I had DAT251 with a talented group, in which many had completed DAT250 the semester before that. We used many of the same technologies then, and I ended up writing much of the same things then, as I did now. Last time I used swagger to test the endpoints, but I thought it looked interesting to learn to do these things with curl instead. And it was! 

### Pending issues 

I opted out of the optional tasks.
